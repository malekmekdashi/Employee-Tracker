  ## Description
  This weeks homework assignment tests our knowledge on mysql, along with previous weeks lessons. We were given the homework assignment to create a database that tracks and adds employees to the database which displays their title, role, department, salary, and manager. I first began by creating the package.json so that I can install the dependancies such as inquirer, mysql, and console.table. To begin this project, we created a database in mysql and and created the schema and seed to make our job a bit easier when adding and updating the app. To begin initiating the application, head on over to the terminal and run "node server.js" and from there you will notice there are several prompts to choose from, and from there  you can add, view, and update anything you like.
